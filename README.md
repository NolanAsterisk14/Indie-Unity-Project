# Indie-Unity-Project

This project was an early stage indie game I worked on as a member of a small independent team that I joined after my schooling.

I spent some months designing and documenting the game before joining the team, where we further refined the design to suit a small team and began the early stages of project development. Due to external circumstances, some members of the project team were unable to continue contributing and the team dissolved as a result.

The game is a medieval themed strategy / turn based RPG, and I had developed the early stages of the battle system before ceasing development.
